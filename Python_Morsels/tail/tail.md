This week I want you to make a function that takes a sequence (like a list, string, or tuple) and a number n and returns the last n elements from the given sequence, as a list.

For example:

>>> tail([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
[3, 4, 5]
>>> tail('hello', 2)
['l', 'o']
>>> tail('hello', 0)
[]

#### Bonus 1

As a bonus, make your function return an empty list for negative values of n ✔️:

>>> tail('hello', -2)
[]

#### Bonus 2

As a second bonus, make sure your function works with any iterable, not just sequences. ✔️ For example:

>>> squares = (n**2 for n in range(10))
>>> tail(squares, 3)
[49, 64, 81]
You should make sure you don't loop at all if n is 0 or negative.

See if you can make your function relatively memory efficient (if you're looping over a very long iterable, don't store the entire thing in memory).

#### Tests

Automated tests for this week's exercise can be found [here](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/exercises/83ed2a27b86b41a185036b262fb67c41/tests/). You'll need to write your function in a module named tail.py next to the test file. To run the tests you'll run "python test_tail.py" and check the output for "OK". You'll see that there are some "expected failures" (or "unexpected successes" maybe). If you'd like to do the bonus, you'll want to comment out the noted lines of code in the tests file to test them properly.
