"""
Given a list of integers and a target value, return the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to a specific target.

*Note: You can assume that each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used more than once.*

Example:

Given nums = [3, 8, 12, 17], target = 15,

Because nums[0] + nums[2] = 3 + 12 = 15,
return [0, 2].
