    "### The Supermarket Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### input\n",
    "* customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.\n",
    "* n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### output\n",
    "The function should return an integer, the total time required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "queue_time([5,3,4], 1)\n",
    "# should return 12\n",
    "# because when n=1, the total time is just the sum of the times\n",
    "\n",
    "queue_time([10,2,3,3], 2)\n",
    "# should return 10\n",
    "# because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the \n",
    "# queue finish before the 1st person has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "queue_time([2,3,10], 2)\n",
    "# should return 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Clarifications\n",
    "* There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and\n",
    "* The order of the queue NEVER changes, and\n",
    "* The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.\n",
    "N.B. You should assume that all the test input will be valid, as specified above.\n",
    "\n",
