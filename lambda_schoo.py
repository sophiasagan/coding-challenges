"""
Given an integer value `n`, write a function that will return a list of the string representation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

However, there are a few additional rules to follow:

- For multiples of three, it should output "Lambda" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, it should output "School" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of three and five, it should output "LambdaSchool" instead of the number.

Example:

n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Lambda",
    "4",
    "School",
    "Lambda",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Lambda",
    "School",
    "11",
    "Lambda",
    "13",
    "14",
    "LambdaSchool"
]
