# In a real-world Python application, if youâ€™re taking input from the user and calling float (docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float), you should probably wrap it within try (docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement), in case the user gives us an illegal value:

# try:
#     n = float(input("Enter a number: "))
#     print(f"n = {n}")
# except ValueError as e:
#     print("Hey!  That's not a valid number!")
